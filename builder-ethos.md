# Builder Ethos

Privacy, scalability, and freedom aren't inevitable. They're built line by line by people who show up, push boundaries, and do the work. TABConf is for those people.

We're enthusiasts aligned not by hype, but by a shared obsession with what comes after you realize Bitcoin is a good idea.

This conference isn't about price charts or fluff pep talks. It’s about what you can do. "You can just build things", from open source projects to full-fledged businesses that rely on them.

TABConf is where ideas surface, tools get built, and experiments happen. It creates an environment where protocol devs, app devs, and end users overlap, exposing pain points and making real progress where those layers meet.

All levels of expertise are welcome. If you're here, you’re not a passive observer, you’re a participant. You’re debating tradeoffs, building tools, hacking sovereignty. And if you're a novice, you're encouraged to learn the ropes and become self-sovereign.

No one buys their way on stage. All proposals are curated transparently on GitHub.

This is a conference that values what you’ve built and worked on since the last time we saw you, and encourages you to keep going.

**Bitcoin is great.**  
*If you know, you know.*  
**What’s next is hacking at TABConf.**
