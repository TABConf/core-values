# TABConf Guidelines

TABConf is a builder-first Bitcoin conference focused on technical progress, interactive formats, and community transparency. The format is intentionally designed to be reproducible and scalable.

---

## Non-Negotiables

- **Focus is on applied Bitcoin tech and self-sovereignty**
- **Must be organized transparently. Preferrably GitHub**
- **No one can buy their way on stage**
- **No exclusivity — attendees get access to all official conference events and content areas**
  - Clear distinction must be made between official conference events and any satellite events

---

## GitHub Usage

- All programming proposals and submissions are done as GitHub Issues
- Schedule is built transparently from accepted proposals
- No talk is accepted without a public submission
- No pay-to-play — every participant earns their spot
- Encourages quality submissions and community review


---

## Sponsorship Transparency

- Sponsorship tiers and benefits are published publicly
- Sponsors may not inorganically influence the schedule or stage content

---

## Format (as done in Atlanta)

- 4-day event
  - First 2 days (Builder Days) are allocated to focus on building, hacking, networking, workshops.
  - Day 3/4 (Conference Days) are allocated for interactive stage events, panels, talks, and villages.
    - villages are designated areas of conference where people can have autonomy over their schedule and content.
- Venue with flexible space allowing parallel tracks

## Inspiration

TABConf draws inspiration from **Def Con**, via the village model and general hacker vibes, and from **BitDevs**, which demonstrated a reproducible event format that empowers local communities while enabling shared resources.
