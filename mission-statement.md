# TABConf Mission Statement

TABConf exists to accelerate meaningful progress in Bitcoin by bringing protocol developers, builders, and curious minds together in one space.

Our mission is to create an environment where people collaborate deeply, surface real-world pain points, challenge assumptions, and build tools that make Bitcoin stronger. Privacy, scalability, and security are not solved problems — TABConf exists because there’s still important work to do.

We focus on:
- Facilitating direct collaboration between protocol and application layers
- Making it clear that self-sovereignty isn't possible without minimum technical competence  
- Showcasing applied Bitcoin technologies through interactive formats

TABConf is hands on by design - hackathons, puzzles, rotating panels, and technical games take priority over passive talks. Every moment should be useful, generative, or fun.

**Until Bitcoin is scalable, private, and secure — the work isn't done.**
